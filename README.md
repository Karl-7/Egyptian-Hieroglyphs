# Egyptian-Hieroglyphs
This project includes a preprocess file and compares the self-modified voting mechanism with existing Resnet 18 and Googlenet V2.
Please only look at these 3 files: resnet.py, googlenet.py, and Sparrownet_V5.py.
All other files are useless and outdated now. Please feel free to look through our efforts, but download only the necessary files to save space.
